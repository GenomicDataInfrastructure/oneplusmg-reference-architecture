| **1+MG**               | **1+ Million Genomes** initiative. A European declaration to make one million sequenced genomes accessible for research and personalized medicine.           |
| **GDI**                | **Genomic Data Infrastructure**. The project funded by the Digital Europe Programme to implement the technical infrastructure for 1+MG.                      |
| **Genome EDIC**        | **Genome European Digital Infrastructure Consortium**. The legal entity responsible for the long-term governance and operation of the 1+MG infrastructure.   |
| **National Node**      | The infrastructure deployed within a Member State to store and process genomic data. Operates under the jurisdiction of that Member State.                   |
| **DAC**                | **Data Access Committee**. The body responsible for reviewing and approving data access requests.                                                            |
