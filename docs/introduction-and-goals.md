# Introduction and Goals

This document provides a comprehensive view on the architecture of the 1+MG Network, following the guidelines of the [arc42](https://arc42.org/) template.

The [1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative](https://framework.onemilliongenomes.eu/) represents an unprecedented pan-European effort to enable secure access to corresponding genomic and clinical data across Europe. The overarching goal is to facilitate better research, personalized healthcare, and health policy-making by making at least one million sequenced genomes accessible for secondary (research) and primary (clinical) use. This reference architecture defines the technical, semantic, and legal frameworks necessary to operationalize this ambition through the Genome European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (Genome EDIC) and the national nodes implemented via the Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project.

This reference architecture provides a high-level blueprint for implementing that vision. It targets technical teams in national genomics programs, policymakers, infrastructure providers, and the emerging Genome EDIC (the central coordinating body for 1+MG) – helping them understand what services each Member State must implement nationally and what services the Genome EDIC must provide centrally to end users.

The architecture is driven by the following high-level business goals:

- **Enable Personalized Medicine & Research:** The primary goal is to make at least one million sequenced genomes accessible for secondary use (research) and primary use (clinical care), supporting the development of personalized treatments and better health policy-making.
- **Ensure Data Sovereignty:** The system must adhere to a federated model where data remains within the jurisdiction of the Member State (National Nodes), respecting local ethical and legal frameworks while enabling cross-border analysis.
- **Sustainable Operation:** The transition from project-based funding (GDI) to the Genome European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (Genome EDIC) requires a cost-effective, sustainable infrastructure model funded by Member States.
- **Trust and Social Acceptance:** The architecture must enforce a robust "Trust Framework" to maintain public trust in genomic data sharing, ensuring that citizens' data is handled securely and ethically.

## Requirements Overview

To achieve these business goals, the system must provide the following core functions:

| ID   | Name                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR01 | Data Governance & Compliance             | The platform must enforce the governance rules of the 1+MG Secondary Use Framework. This means integrating workflows for data provider compliance checks (ensuring that only datasets meeting ethical/legal criteria and data quality standards are made available). The National Contact Point (NCP) or delegate must be able to validate that each dataset and its metadata comply with 1+MG inclusion requirements (e.g. proper consent, ethics approval, standardized format) before it’s listed in the catalogue. Additionally, the system should support recording and honouring any data use restrictions or data subject consent preferences attached to datasets (ELSIs metadata). |
| FR02 | Cross-border Discovery                   | A core requirement is to maintain an up-to-date metadata catalogue of all 1+MG datasets. This catalogue will store descriptive information (cohort descriptions, data dictionary, etc.). Researchers should be able to easily find what data exists (e.g. via the central 1+MG portal) and see high-level info without accessing the raw data. The system must expose search and discovery features (e.g. ability to query by disease, variant, etc.) and return aggregate results to inform researchers before they make access requests. This includes the ability to perform population-level queries (counts of individuals matching criteria) as a form of feasibility analysis.       |
| FR03 | Federated Access Request Management      | The solution requires a mechanism for users to request access to datasets and for those requests to be reviewed and approved by the appropriate authorities. Functionally, this will be implemented via an Access Management portal/workflow integrated with the 1+MG User Portal. It should collect project proposals from researchers, route them to the national review committee, track decisions, and if approved, grant data access in a controlled manner. The system should enforce conditions on usage (e.g. read-only access within secure environment, no re-identification attempts) and be able to revoke access if needed.                                                    |
| FR04 | Secure Processing Environment (SPE)      | To use the data, authorized users need computational access. A requirement is to provide a Secure Analysis Workspace where users can run analyses on the permitted data. This environment should offer analytical tools but restrict the export of raw data. It must integrate with the access control (only allowing logged-in, authorized users) and log all operations for compliance. Performance and usability are considerations here: the environment should support the large-scale data analysis (e.g. pipeline for genome-wide association studies) with adequate computing resources, while preventing data exfiltration.                                                        |
| FR05 | Semantic Harmonization & Data Onboarding | The platform must include processes to onboard new data sources continuously. This involves technical connectors or ETL scripts from hospitals, labs, or research databases into the Node. It should support periodic updates (e.g. adding new genome sequences or updating clinical follow-up data for an existing cohort) without compromising data integrity. Data onboarding also encompasses data cleaning and standardization tasks (for example, harmonizing phenotype codes to agreed ontologies). The system should provide administrators with tools to perform these tasks and validate that each update maintains compliance (no unauthorized data).                            |
| FR06 | Alignment with EHDS and National eHealth | The system design should anticipate upcoming EHDS interoperability requirements for secondary use. For example, if the EHDS mandates certain APIs or data formats for health data access bodies, our implementation should be compatible. Additionally, while not the primary focus, the solution should be able to interface with national eHealth systems where necessary – for instance, verifying patient consents via national health registries or retrieving updated clinical data. Ensuring this alignment means the 1+MG infrastructure can become an integral part of the broader health data ecosystem and take advantage of future EU health data exchange mechanisms.          |

## Quality Goals

The architecture is shaped by specific quality attributes that guide design decisions:

| ID  | Quality Goal       | Description                                                                                                           | Motivation                                                                                                                                    |
| --- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| QG1 | Interoperability   | The ability of diverse national systems to exchange data and compute instructions using open standards (GA4GH, FHIR). | Essential to overcome the fragmentation of 25+ different national healthcare systems and tech stacks.                                         |
| QG2 | Security & Privacy | Strict adherence to GDPR and national regulations, implementing "Privacy by Design" and "Zero Trust" principles.      | A single breach could undermine the entire political initiative. Compliance with the emerging European Health Data Space (EHDS) is mandatory. |
| QG3 | Scalability        | The capacity to handle petabytes of genomic data and high-throughput analysis requests.                               | The system must scale from current pilots to >1 million genomes without performance degradation.                                              |
| QG4 | Transparency       | Visibility into how data is used and processed.                                                                       | Required for auditing and to maintain the trust of data subjects (citizens).                                                                  |
| QG5 | Usability          | Streamlined user journeys for researchers and clinicians.                                                             | Reducing the administrative burden of finding data and applying for access (DACs) is key to system uptake.                                    |
